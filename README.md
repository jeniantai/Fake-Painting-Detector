## Problem
One of the biggest challenges of an purchasing a painting at an auction is the risk of that the painting might have serious issues that prevent it from being sold to customers. The artist community calls these unfortunate purchases "fakes","lemons", "kicks" or "Bad Buys". Can machine learning help us to figure out the risk?

## Step by Step Approach
1) Exploratory Analysis
2) Data Cleaning
3) Feature Engineering
4) Random Forest
5) XGBoost
6) Cross Validation (Repeat for each model)
7) Feature Selection / reduction
8) Summarize result on test set

## Result
xgBoost delivered 90% accuracy in classifying the 'Bad Buys'
