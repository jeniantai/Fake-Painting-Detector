## Problem
One of the biggest challenges of an purchasing a painting at an auction is the risk of that the painting might have serious issues that prevent it from being sold to customers. The artist community calls these unfortunate purchases "fakes","lemons", "kicks" or "Bad Buys". Can machine learning help us to figure out the risk?
